The readability of this code is good since this code file does not have too much logic or nested conditions.
The programmer can understand the intent of the code easily. Also, the name of each variable is clear. 
All the variables are the V shape name, and each name is meaningful. Even there have some long method bodies, 
but the logic behind the long code is easy.

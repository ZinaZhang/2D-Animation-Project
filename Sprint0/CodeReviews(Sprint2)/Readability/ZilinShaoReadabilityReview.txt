Player1.cs
Main Author: Zhizhou He, Lufei Ouyang, ChuwenSun


Generally speaking, this class has high readability. Basically, it is a class for our object
Link. It is the only character we could control currently so the class is named Player1.cs.
The variables's names and functions' order are both OK. I can easily understand its function
either as itself or with State class. Also, for the design of this class, other contributors
can easily add functions and not effect the class's conciseness.

The readability of this file is high. Due to its names of functions. First for coordinations
with other class, it has GetDamage(), GetHitBox(), GetPosition(). Then it has a list of
instance methods to perform projectiles' behaviors like Shoot, Explode. Besides, a function
named isExplode return an integer to present the kind of behavior this projectile does.
As whole, Lufei's code is brief and easy to read.

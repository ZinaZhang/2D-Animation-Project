ItemSlot.cs, Handbook.cs
Main Author: Zhizhou He
Time: 15 min

For ItemSlot.cs,some of the variables use some meaningless name, which
reduces the readability. Some of the long methods may split into separate methods.
Also, the length of the code reduces the readability of the code, but the logic behind this code is 
relatively clear so it is easy to understand. Furthermore, all the variables follow the PascalCase, 
which makes reading more seamless.

The Handbook.cs almost has the same idea and same coding style with ItemSlot.cs, which means they have 
same advantages and disadvantages. The code and some of the methods are too long, but the logic is clear. 
And some variables have meaningless names. The author can make the code
have more readability if he revises those shortcomings.

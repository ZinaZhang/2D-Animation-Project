ItemSlot.cs, Handbook.cs
Main Author: Zhizhou He
Time: 15 min


The ItemSlot.cs and Handbook.cs both contain long methods, those methods may 
split into separate methods.Both classes have the same idea and coding style, and 
both classes have high cohesion, which makes the code maintainable and reusable.
Also, the logic behind each method is simple. And different function does a different 
thing, which makes the code modular, and it increases the testability.
One suggestion to this class is that try not to use public fields, it can make the data unsafe, 
and it can make the code has tight coupling.Fixing this can increase the overall maintainability of the code.

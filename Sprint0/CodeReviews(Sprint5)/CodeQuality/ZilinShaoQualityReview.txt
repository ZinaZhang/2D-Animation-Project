In Sprint5, we added NPC Merchant's store. The class coordinates and has information flow with
Player, IItem, Sprite class and so on. But He did not couple each modules over tightly. 
With the low coupling implementation, He's code has high maintainability, making it easy
for debugging and code reuse. Hence I would say He's code has good quality.

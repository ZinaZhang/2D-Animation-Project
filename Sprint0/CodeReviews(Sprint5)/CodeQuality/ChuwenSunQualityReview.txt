Main Author: Lufei Ouyang
Time: 10 min

The code quality is high, linkages are clear, using foreach to iterate through all the elements in the npc list to see if the specific
NPC has collision with Link so the game create specific reaction. And the use of if-else statement produced the different possibilities
of different directions of the collisions.

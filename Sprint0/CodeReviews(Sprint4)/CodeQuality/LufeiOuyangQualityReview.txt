The code file does not have much logic or nesting conditions.
Each different state corresponds to a different method, which makes the code modular and increases testability.
This means that maintainability is very high. If you want to change something, you only need to change the corresponding method.
Easy to implement and easy to manage. In general, the quality of this code is good.

The Player1 class has been created by Ouyang since Sprint2, here I refer to his new implementation of player's
projectiles. In last Sprint, our weapons and link are combined, and we detached them in this sprint. Places of
execellence of Ouyang's implementation of Projectiles are its complete functions of collisions and shooting CD.
And he implementated these functions successfully mainly owe to Player1 class's high cohesion and low coupling.
That is to say, Player1 class's code has high maintainbility.

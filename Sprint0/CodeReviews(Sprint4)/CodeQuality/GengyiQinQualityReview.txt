The quality of the code is high, as the linkages are clear, which is good for future updates. This class is mainly responsible for updates and drawing during game time. 
The if statements and logic in Draw method is a little bit long, but it is understandable and practical overall in my opinion. Maybe the logic in Draw and Update, including
the collision logic, can be summed up in other methods so that these two methods can be simplified.

Logical is great. He edited a lot logic error from last edition Player1 and added sound in a good way without error. 
I like how he use a list to store different method to include different sounds. This makes the future update easy.
He have different method for each item and include sound and other method like state in it. That makes state flexible to edit. 
He also eidt the boarder of the screen and link walking range, and link hp.
It might be better to have a wider range for hp, so he might want to use switch in the future to have clearer look for link's hp

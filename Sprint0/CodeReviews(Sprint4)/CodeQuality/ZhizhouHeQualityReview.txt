This file plays one of the most important roles in the game. Although the code is not very long, I think the difficulty and functionality are high.

The code connects with Game.cs to get current room information, it will be invoked while player goes to another room.
The code uses Update() function to change the Room's source rectangle so it looks like scrolling to another one. I think it is very smart.

This code is also derives Pause screen scrolling, so it has good expansibility.

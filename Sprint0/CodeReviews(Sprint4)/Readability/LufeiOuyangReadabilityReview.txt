The logic of Inventory.cs is very clear. Not too many nesting conditions can improve the readability of the entire document.
Zhizhou also uses comments for each condition,
this makes the code easier to understand. Furthermore, the name of each variable is Pascal naming convention,
Therefore, it improves the readability of the entire code. 
Overall, Inventory.cs is a great class. It is very easy to understand the meaning of the code.

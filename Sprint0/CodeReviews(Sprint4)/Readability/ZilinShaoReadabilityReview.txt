The readability of this file is high. Due to its name of functions and variables, I can easily
understand and collaborate with his class. It also has some brief comments to help read. 
Its readability also reflects during runtime, since a few codes of "Console.WriteLine" exist,
which can make player or tester know what part of Inventory's functions have been called just
now.

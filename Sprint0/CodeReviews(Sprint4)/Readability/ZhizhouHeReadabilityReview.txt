In the first glance, the file has very neat layout so it is very easy to check its functionality .

The code stucture is relatively easy. The staticMapDraw funtion is for drawing the visited map and it is sepearted from
the Draw() method, so it is easy for maintence and any modification. 

The code uses good names for variable so it is easy to know what they do. 

In conclusion, I think the readability of this code is good.

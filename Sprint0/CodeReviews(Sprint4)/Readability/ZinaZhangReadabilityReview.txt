The code might be bettwe if more comments added. It tooks me some time to read his code. 
Every varilable is named properly.
Swich case is better than if else statement, where he did a good job on this to seperate several cases. (In itemSlot)
There might be a way to combine those cases together for a shorter code.
In HudFrame, it might be better if _link can be naned as link for a better look.

Generally speaking the code is readable, but the if-else statement and switch block are a bit too long and can be messy.
Some comments to separate the switch block into several segments may be good to improve the readability, as the comments can indicate
the initialization for different types: enemies, blocks, rooms etc., and they can make future maintenence a bit easier.

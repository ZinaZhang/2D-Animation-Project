I think the readability of this code is okay. 
The code looks long because it has many method for Link's movement.
This code plays a crucial role in the project because it contains all function that related to Link's states and actions.
Each method directly invode the corresponding method in P1State.cs so I think it looks very clear and easy to understand.

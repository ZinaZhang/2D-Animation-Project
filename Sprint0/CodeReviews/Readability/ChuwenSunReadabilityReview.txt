The code of this class is highly readable, all the initializations and methods are pretty easy to read and maintain in the long run since it kind of creates a simple
formula for us to input a new sprite and use it in the game.
All the methods are easy to understand and read, also specific comments are presented to improve the readability. So I think in general this class is highly readable.

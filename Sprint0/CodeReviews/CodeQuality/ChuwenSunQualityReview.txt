I think the quality of this code is high. The code is very coherent. The methods of code are public because they can be called by every concrete classes of ICommand.execute().
If-else statements are used in Update() which is the most well-done method in this class. And it solved the problem that Link does not come back to standing state while we release the moving button.
Other methods are pretty clean and easy to maintain in the long run.

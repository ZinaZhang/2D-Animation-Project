Logical in itemsController are clear with variable names declared. 
In spriteFactory, it is good when he seperate different items in different content method. It is easy to control differnet type of sprite in this way, 
and it is easy to change one of the type without interupt others.
By using list, it is easy to control and see different type of sprites.
Overall good quality in code due to high flexibility.

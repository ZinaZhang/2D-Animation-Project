P1State.cs
Main Author: Zhizhou He, Chuwen Sun
Time: 10 min

This code file does not have too much logic or nested conditions.
Each different state corresponds to a different method. 
Which means the maintainability is very high. If we want to change something, we only need to change the corresponding method.
For example, the enum of facing and status make this code easy to maintain. Also the Extensibility is good, 
to add new states later, just create a new method, and then add new states in the enum. 
Very easy to implement and very easy to manage. Overall, the quality of this code is good.

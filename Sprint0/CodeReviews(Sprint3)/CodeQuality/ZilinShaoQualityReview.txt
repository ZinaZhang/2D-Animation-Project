I think the code quality of this file is high. The Loader basically read the sprites' information
stored in our xml format files. Its implementation achieves its expected functionality well. It used
many List objects to handle mutiple object classes. All warnings are removed. We can easily create 
new sprites by adding few lines of code in Loader file.

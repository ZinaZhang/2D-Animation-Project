LinkItemCollision.cs, HealthBar.cs
Main Author: Zilin Shao
Time: 5 min


The LinkItemCollision class contains a large nested condition loop, and several if-else statements inside the loop, which is a four-level nested structure. 
I think the author might need to fix it by using more clear logic. 

The HealthBar is inherited from the HUD interface. The HUD interface makes the code maintainable and reusable. Also, all the functions that the author wrote are good. 
The logic behind each function is simple. And different function does a different thing, which makes the code modular, and it increases the testability. 
One suggestion to this class is that try not to use public fields, it can make the data unsafe.

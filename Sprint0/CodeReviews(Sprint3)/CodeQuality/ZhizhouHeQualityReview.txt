LinkEnemyCollision

I think the quality of this file is pretty high. The file uses the intersection area's hight and width to determine the direction Link collides the enemy which I think is a very good way.
The function LinkEnemyCollision(Player1 player) has Player as a parameter so it can be invoked by different players.
And same way, the EnemyCollisionTest(List<IEnemy> enemies) can be applied by different enemies. 
My suggestion to this file is just about some name of variable and even the file name since this file will be called by not just Link but other players.

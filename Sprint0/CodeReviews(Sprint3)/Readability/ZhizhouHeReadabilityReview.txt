I think this file has good readability. The stucture of this file is coherent.
First it use a big IF statement to determine if Player has collison. Then it use an IF-ELSE statement to determine the direction: From Up or Down, or Left or Right.
And then it deals with specific conditions. 
This file's idea and structure also be used in other collision related file and it works well. So I think it has good portability.

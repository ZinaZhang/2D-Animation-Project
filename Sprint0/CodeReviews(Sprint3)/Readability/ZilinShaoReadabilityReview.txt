The readability of this file is high. First, it has a brief construct as whole. A variable 
initialization, a constructor, and a method doing all the collision handling works. A foreach
loop dealed with collision with each enemy. Comments are added inside the nested if statements,
so reader of this file can understand how different if statements deal with different collisions
within the first glance.

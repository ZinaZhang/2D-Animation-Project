Known bugs for Sprint2
-----------------------------------
1. There is a solid color square around sprite.
2. The damaging state only shows green color currently. We played the game online and found the Link will be push backward when he takes damage.
	So we decided to put it here first, and then make specific changes according to the requirements later.
